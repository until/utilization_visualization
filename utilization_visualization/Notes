Set up to store in sqlite
then pull data from sqlite
categories should scheduled, maintenance, etc., all with light and shorter boxes
then run time or not with taller red boxes

So...
- Device
- Start time
- End time
- event type
- event details

I really need to get this into github

How do I build up tests in here?
